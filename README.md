🚀 Phishing Link Scanner
An intelligent Phishing Link Scanner built with Python and Streamlit using GENAI API and an LLM-based approach. This project is designed to detect and analyze phishing links, providing enhanced security against cyber threats.

🌟 Features
Real-Time Phishing Detection: Scans URLs and identifies potential phishing threats.
Intuitive Web Interface: Built using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes GENAI's advanced language models for intelligent threat detection.
User-Friendly: Easy-to-use interface suitable for both technical and non-technical users.

👨‍💻 Tech Stack
Python – Core functionalities and backend logic.
Streamlit – To create an interactive and user-friendly web app.
GENAI API – For leveraging advanced language models in phishing detection.
LLM-based Approach – Ensures accurate threat analysis and intelligent decision-making.

🚀 How It Works
Enter a URL: The user inputs a URL they want to check.
Real-Time Analysis: The system uses GENAI's language model to analyze the URL.
Phishing Detection: The model evaluates the link's characteristics to detect phishing threats.
Detailed Report: The result is displayed, indicating whether the URL is safe or potentially malicious.
